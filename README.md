# **Hi there 👋, I'm Greash**

I am a Data Science student 👨🏻‍🎓 from Great Lakes Institute of Management 🏫.
I am from India 🇮🇳.
I'm an aspiring Data Scientist who enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams👫, or applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in engineering👨🏻‍🏫, statistics, and machine learning.
My passion lies in solving business problems with tailored data and algorithms and communicating complex ideas.

Love ❤️ towards playing with data and python made me to transition from Mechanical engineer👨🏻‍🔧 -> Data Science📊.
