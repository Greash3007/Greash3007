# **Hi there üëã, I'm Greash**

I am a Data Science student üë®üèª‚Äçüéì from Great Lakes Institute of Management üè´.
I am from India üáÆüá≥.
I'm an aspiring Data Scientist who enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in engineering, statistics, and machine learning.
My passion lies in solving business problems with tailored data and algorithms and communicating complex ideas.

Love ‚ù§Ô∏è towards playing with data and python made me to transition from Mechanical engineerüë®üèª‚Äçüîß -> Data Scienceüìä
